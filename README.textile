h1. My Emacs Configuration

This git repository is my personal Emacs configuration and set up.  It is set up so that you can base your configuration off of it, with your own customizations, and still keep the base configuration up to date.  I have attempted to make it as easy to set up and use as I can, though it can always be improved.  If you have suggestions, recommendations or feedback I'd be very happy to hear from you.

h1. Installation

I've tried to make installation as simple as possible.  No, scratch that, I've made it as easy for me to write as possible.  Once you've cloned the git repository, symlink (or copy if you can't symlink) the <code>.emacs</code> file from the git repository to your <code>$HOME</code> directory and run <code>bootstrap.sh</code>.  This is typically accomplished on a unix platform with commands like the following:

<pre>
kyle@indigo64 ~$ mkdir -p personal/projects
kyle@indigo64 ~$ cd personal/projects
kyle@indigo64 ~/personal/projects$ git clone git://github.com/kyleburton/krbemacs.git
kyle@indigo64 ~/personal/projects$ cd krbemacs
kyle@indigo64 ~/personal/projects/krbemacs$ ln -s $(pwd)/.emacs ~
kyle@indigo64 ~/personal/projects/krbemacs$ bash bootstrap.sh
</pre>

h2. Pre-requisites

You will need to have a modern Emacs installed, be on a unix-like system and have shell utilities like curl.
